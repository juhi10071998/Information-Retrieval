## Psychological Counselling Information Retrieval

### This application is designed to retrieve information about similar cases and episodes given the user (therapist) knows a few details about the patient. The information retrieved will be cases similar to the patient and can help the therapist treat him/her better and also help the therapist in how to go about new and uncertain cases. The therapist can also use this search engine if he/she would like to volunteer to help other patients who are in need and cannot afford a therapist.
